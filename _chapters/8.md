# Ice Cream, Parfaits, Ices, Sherberts, Candy

> the sweetening only Kings could afford until the 13th century

## Digitizer's Note:

Sherbet is misspelled.  This is a common misspelling/mispronunciation.  In my opinion it's at or approaching the level of a variant, and I like this spelling better than the more prescriptively correct Sherbet.
