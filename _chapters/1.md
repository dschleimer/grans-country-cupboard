# Party Snacks & Drinks

Victorians called snacks "thumb-bits" as most were eaten with the fingers and were meant to appease the appetite.  They sought a perfect balance between the light and the hearty, the bland and space, and the plan and the rich.

Drinks have always varied with the time, the place, the occasion, and the people.
