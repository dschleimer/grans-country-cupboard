# Vegetables, Noodles, Spaghetti, fresh fruits

Vegetables were highly regarded during the Roman Empire.  Cabbage was eaten to ward off drunkenness; onions and leeks to build up strength and mushrooms were such treasures that their sale was permitted only to the wealthy patriticians.

George Washington's kitchen garden grew every known vegetable of his time - beats, beans turnips, squash, pear, parsnips, sweet peppers, tomatoes, white and sweet potatioes.

Fruits have always been enjoyed by King and Commoner alike.
