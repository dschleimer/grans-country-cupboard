# Seafood, Meats, Poulty, Game

## Fish -
> "the glory of the master inspired by genius; the stumbling block of ordinery cooks"

## Meat -
> Heaven sends us good meat but the devil sends cooks

## Turkey -
> One of the finest gifts which the old world has received from the new.

## Game
> The meat of noblemen - beef was peasant fodder

### Digitizer's note
I (David) find this quote odd, given the etymology of beef runs through the Old French boef.  We have a separate word for meet of the cow precisely because the French-speaking aristocracy ate it.

The only game animal I'm aware of where we have a separate name for the meet is venison for deer.
