# Canning Freezing, Preserving, Relishes, Pickling, Wine Making, Curing + Seasoning Meats

Wine, like bread has been valued as one of the blessings of line.

## Philadelphia, Penns. + views
- Madeira is used for Philadeplhia Terrapin
- Sherry is used for Philadelphia supper soup
- Sherry is used for chicken Ã  la king - from an old Philadelphia hotel

## Digitizer's Note:
Terrapin does seem to be referring to the turtle here.  It seems as though there used to be a kind of turtle soup commonly consumed in Philly: https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-turtles-of-philadelphias-culinary-past/

I'm not sure the word in the section heading after Penns. is views.  The writing doesn't quite seem to match up, though the word seems like it would roughly fi\t the phrase.
