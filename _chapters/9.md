# Canning Freezing, Preserving, Relishes, Pickling, Wine Making, Curing + Seasoning Meats

Wine, like bread has been valued as one of the blessings of line.

## Philadelphia, Penna. + wines
- Madeira is used for Philadelphia Terrapin
- Sherry is used for Philadelphia supper soup
- Sherry is used for chicken Ã  la king - from an old Philadelphia hotel

## Digitizer's Note:
Terrapin does seem to be referring to the turtle here.  It seems as though there used to be a kind of turtle soup commonly consumed in Philly: https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/the-turtles-of-philadelphias-culinary-past/
