## Simple rules for desserts

* Hot weather - a cool dessert
* S\[unreadable\] starchy meal - pudding or cake dessert
* Company for dinner - fancy dessert.
* Prepare ahead of time if possible
* Prepare for more than one meal

## Digitizer's Note
I believe Crueller in the original is a mistake for Cruller.  I can't find any indication Crueller is a historic or variant spelling via googling.

Given this is a chapter title, I have chosen to correct the spelling.

Additionally, there's clearly an S, but I can't think of a 3 or 4 letter S word that fits in front of Starchy.  Suggestions welcome, please.
