This is a digitization of my great grandmother's cookbook.
The original was written by Elizabeth M. McGinley some time before
I was born.

She hand-wrote 209 pages and had a number of copies made
and distributed to then-extant family.  My mother (the authors granddaughter)
had two copies, and gave one to me.

I scanned my copy, and am building this
website in an attempt to make the recipes contained therein more accessible, 
both to my family, and to myself.  I hope that making them easier to read and
search will lead to them seeing more use.
